# 4 Developer Guidelines

## 4.1 Integration/Automation Types

webMethods.io Integration currently provides two different approaches for developing integrations

* No-code Workflow Automations
* Low-code FlowServices Integrations

First, I'd like to explain the differences between these two approaches, their target persona, and some characteristics between these.

### 4.1.1 Workflow

#### Overview

[Workflow](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/workflow_building_blocks/creating_first_workflow/) is a __No-code__ graphical orchestration editor, facilitating the creation of automations for a non-developer.  A user constructs workflow automations by dragging and dropping actions and integration blocks (typically created by more technical users), then links these with simple decision logic by dragging arrows between the actions, and same with the data fields.

Workflow is intended to be powerful, yet very easy to way to orchestrate pre-existing assets including the out-of-the-box connectors, and as such the lacks complex conditional logic and looping constructs a typical developer or integration specialist user would expect.

Due to its power, some people mistake workflow for a programmatic construction tool, and can often attempt to create very complex logic which is a misuse of the tool.

#### Typical Users/Persona

Workflow is most typically used by a __Technical business user__.

Somebody usually from the business side of the organization (not IT), and uses technology for business usage, with both internal and external needs.  They tend to have good IT experience, and can understand basic programmatic logic and constructs, and as such are more than capable of using no-code applications.  Some of these people may be more technical roles such as data scientist, software engineers and even developers, but are still part of a non-technical team, e.g. Marketing and often responsible for algorithms, analytics, pricing, and integration of data flows, and/or customer service interactions.

In addition to being used primarily by the technical business user, workflows are also used by more developer centric roles because of the simplicity, allowing them to focus on the business need, and avoid the cognitive load of creating a more complex solution.

### 4.1.2 FlowServices

#### Overview

[FlowServices](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/flowservices/) are __Low-Code__ integrations, providing more programmatical constructs for power users, and those comfortable with programming, such as if/then/else, try catch, and complex looping such as repeat, do/until, and do-while statements.  
A FlowService can enforce an input and output contract, ensuring you think about the data that it will receive and return, and along with this facilitates more complex mapping requirements, with conditional maps, index based maps, constructs to rearrange the data structures wholly, and more.

Flows services are created top to bottom, using the keyboard or mouse and represented like a typical program, however the powerful mapper is used in place of variable definitions and data logic.

They are also the exact same FlowServices that exist in our self-hosted products, so a user with existing knowledge of webMethods can quickly and easily pick up and create FlowService logic in minutes.

#### Typical Users/Persona

FlowServices are typically used by __Integration Specialists / Developers__.

An integration specialist provides integration expertise, and often works in an Integration Center or Excellence (or competency center). They are typically responsible for integration of 'Tier 1' systems of records that are mission critical, and often self-hosted, though more frequently includes the large SaaS vendors now.  Since they work with tier 1 systems, they need to implement complex logic that is fault-tolerant, and implement high throughput, high performance real time integrations. 

Developers have a similar skill set but come from a more standard programmatic background and as such look for recognizable programmatic constructs.

| Integration Execution & Scalability | When executed, workflows are queued, and then allocated to an execution environment when one is available.  Paid customers have dedicated queues and their own execution pool, whereas free customers share the queue/execution pool.  If the execution pool becomes exhausted, whilst we do scale up, you may see periods where a short wait may occur for an execution environment to become available or for the additional nodes to join the pool | FlowServices run in a multithreaded server and immediately execute synchronously.  Flow services execute straight through and therefore provide significantly more performance than a workflow.  Multiple engines, also with scaling service the FlowService executions.                                                                                                                 |
| Maximum Asynchronous Execution Time | Asynchronous Workflows can run for a maximum of 30 minutes, with the maximum duration being configurable for each Workflow. Should there be a need for Workflows to run for longer than 30 minutes will need to be executed across multiple engines, chained via invocations or messaging                                                                                                                                                              | A FlowService has no maximum execution time and can run for as long as is needed, however FlowServices are typically synchronous that can facilitate Asynchronous needs, via an HTTP call, or through the use of messaging.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Maximum Synchronous Execution Time  | Synchronous Workflows are those run through webHooks or via API calls with a return sync response.  These maintain an open connection between the invoker and the server until the workflow has finished, or a timeout is reached.  This timeout can be from the workflow engine, or from the ingress layer and the maximum possible execution time is 3 minutes.                                                                                    | FlowServices are synchronous integrations and as they are running in a multithreaded and scaled engine, these can run indefinitely.  To avoid thread starvation, loops which could run indefinitely have a timeout set on them which cannot be altered.  This value is defaulted currently to 6 hours and cannot be changed.  These loops include repeat for count, while/do and do/until. |
| RAM / Available Memory              | Workflows for paid customers execute in a 1GB execution environment.  Free customers execute in a 256MB environment.  You can see the memory size in the debug pane when you manually run a workflow in the editor. As each action in a workflow is additive, and actions cannot be dropped, the memory can be quickly exhausted when consuming large (typically file based payloads)                                                               | The integration servers have ~14GB of RAM available to them, which along with streaming and FlatFile parsing capabilities resulting in ability to support considerably larger file sizes when an integration is implemented correctly                                                                                                                                                     |
